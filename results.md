## Overview

Our project uses the openflights data set from https://openflights.org/data.html to perform two main algorithms: Dijkstra and Page Rank. We first appended the airports dataset to include the flight distance at the last column. With that, we created a graph using adjacency list and implemented Breadth First Search to check if airports are connected.
